    This is my favorite place because I really enjoy the view of the city and the water. I also enjoy walking around the park and playing basketball here with my friends.

        Something no one would expect about me is that I love to cook and I am a huge foodie. I love to try new foods and I love to cook for my friends and family. I also love to try new resturants and I love to travel to try new foods.
